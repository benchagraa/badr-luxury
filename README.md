A personal hotel/resort react project, unit tested with Jest. 
Used React Query and applied well-off design patterns. 
For the database I used Supabase (greatest Firebase alternative).

What's been used in this project:

- Smooth UX design
- Used design patterns like Render Pros, Higher Order Components and Error Boundary.
- Used React Query.
- Used Jest to test components, especially custom hooks (where most of the logic is)
- Clean code.
- Separate the presentation logic from the business logic.
- Used Recharts for charts.

For CI:
  - Used Azure DevOps CI to create a build/test pipeline.
